# ipods.cf-website
 A website that is, in fact, a giant fucking meme

What, did you come here expecting a real repository? Nah mate, you've been fooled, jipped, cajoled,
tricked, decieved, and possibly even bamboozled beyond the belief of humanity, you utter fool!
What would even be here? Actual code? A half-decent website? Do you know how hard it is to make
decent websites FROM SCRATCH? I'm not exactly one of the guys that made the Motherfucking Website.
Nah mate, that's what squarespace is for, they're the place to go for a BEAUTIFUL fucking website without a whole lotta-- Aaah, just messing with you.

Meme aside, this is the repo for iPods.cf. If you came here looking for the wiki.iPods.cf repo, this ain't it chief. If you're just here to look for secrets, shame on you for not doing it the REAL way. If you would like to contribute to this glorious meme, just make a pull request, I'll review it, and more than likely add it.
