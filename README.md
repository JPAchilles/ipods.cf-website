# ipods.cf-website
 A website that is, in fact, a giant fucking meme

What, did you come here expecting a real repository? Nah mate, you've been fooled, jipped, cajoled,
tricked, decieved, and possibly even bamboozled beyond the belief of humanity, you utter fool!
What would even be here? Actual code? A half-decent website? Do you know how hard it is to make
decent websites FROM SCRATCH? I'm not exactly one of the guys that made the Motherfucking Website
Nah mate, that's what squarespace is for, they're the place to go for a BEAUTIFUL fucking website without a whole lot of hassle.
They've got fucking 24/7 support via live chat and email, and all of their templates feature responsive design so your site can look
great, no matter what device you're running it on, even that iPod Mini you're so obsessed with for some reason.
They've got tons of great features like, oh I dunno, a guy that doesn't basically copy paste his last copypasta because
he/she/it was lazy?

Meme aside, if you would like to contribute to this glorious meme, just make a pull request, and I'll review it.
