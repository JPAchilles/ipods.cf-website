<!-- Here's a story that happened to me back in 2016. Picture this: It's Junior Year, I live in a town of ~1000 people, everything is within walking distance, and the longest single stretch of road is only two miles, but damn near everyone and everything is within half a mile. This town is smaller than the discord I wrote out this story in, the graduating class of 2017 (my year) is smaller than the number of active players on the main server. I go to Subway after school because I'm hungry, and I just got a job again, so I wanna treat myself to *one of only four restaurants in the town.* I also want to go there to get some work done, blah blah whatever.

So I go there and I order my usual sandwich, and I sit down at a table and whip out my laptop, but I don't turn it on right away because I want to eat n shit. It's a Lenovo Thinkpad E545, the shitty base spec AMD model. Enter *Karen,* complete with the hairdo and "I want to see your manager" look and attitude, except she's 50-something and looks like she was just pulled out of a can of sardines. She goes to the counter and orders, but I don't really care all that much. We're the only two people in the store besides the homeless guy that more or less lives there (cool dude btw.) I finish my sandwich as she's finished her order, which she takes to-go, but sits down at the booth behind me for some reason, and this is the point where I actually turn my laptop on.

I regretted turning it on late, because my hard drive was *slow as fuck.* And as I'm sitting there waiting for it to boot, she freaks the FUCK out. I don't remember exactly what she said, so this is paraphrased.

"What are you doing you twerp!" She says as I turn around, fucking puzzled that I'm being screamed at for doing literally nothing. My laptop normally took about 3 minutes to boot, so all I could do was literally twiddle my thumbs and watch; I was quite literally DOING NOTHING. I didn't even really get a response in because I was stunned, stammering, and otherwise being yelled over. She accused me of stuff like stealing her credit cards, hacking into her facebook, and (I for a fact remember this one) ruining her marriage.

Fun fact, I've seen that last one actually play out in front of me. Between my parents. Granted, their relationship was long ruined before then for other reasons, but it's an argument I've seen happen all the same.

So the guy behind the counter and the homeless dude in the store stop her for long enough for me to get in "What the fuck did I do to you??!?!" and this is the point where Windows finally boots. The second the login screen shows up and it no longer looks like a server when it's not headless, she starts screaming that "You're trying to hide it, I fucking knew it, kids can't be trusted, YOU can't be trusted, fuck you" and a bunch of other really nasty shit, and she goes to grab my laptop. Now, I've always been poor as fuck. I cannot afford anything to happen to this laptop, it is the only working electronic I owned besides my phone, and I didn't pay for that, but I DID pay for that laptop, with my own blood, sweat, and tears. We had been through a lot together. I'm working while going to high school for fucks sake, I was homeless AND in the foster system, so that should tell you just how much I was NOT having that.

Grapples turn into kicks, which turn into shoves and punches, but this isn't where the police get called. Not when she went for the eyes, not when she tried to kick my laptop, not when I tried to punch her in the eye and missed, none of that. What happens is that the Subway employee and the homeless dude physically restrain us, and this woman takes the opportunity to call the police. But she doesn't report an assault, nah, none of that. No, she reports to the police that she's been "hacked in real life." Those were her actual words that she puked out of her mouth, stammering on adrenaline.

The first responder didn't hang up on her or anything, in fact they stayed on the line for an hour (as 911 responders should.) And as such, we all stayed there, standing around like a bunch of morons, for an hour. I never really got the chance to explain myself, because the second that I either tried to speak, move, stare at anything, stare at nothing, go for my laptop, fucking BREATHE  weirdly, this woman would freak out, and we'd be back at square one.

So I'm sitting there, actually a bit worried considering the police are still on the line, and I'm thinking to myself "Am I going to be arrested for fucking EXISTING?" I couldn't explain myself, I couldn't mind myself, I couldn't even go piss myself. Lovely fuckin situation, and it wasn't even my fault. Buuuuuut the employee and the 911 responder did start talking to her, who was she, what's going on with her, all that jazz, and as it would turn out, the Subway guy knew her, and she had a reputation.

She's your stereotypical church-going, god-fearing woman who had never left this town in her entire life (and it really IS a town, and nothing more than one,) and that's how she intended to stay for the rest of her life. I should mention now, there was literally one one black guy in town and an asian family of 3 that ran one of those four restaurants I mentioned earlier, but other than that everyone in this town was of originally Irish descent since the town had been formed in the late 1800's. This was a town of all white isolated church-fearing folk, except there were TWELVE CHURCHES, and they all hated eachother vehemently. But there was two things that united them above all else: Fox News, and a fear of the unknown. For those of you reading who are actually from Waldport, Oregon, hi! Yes, I know we weren't ALL like that, but it was a shocking majority, all things considered. And everyone thought that everyone else who went to another church was the Fox News worshipping "everything wrong with the world" type. The only ones who weren't like this more often than not were the ones that didn't go to church in that town at all. But back to the story. There were, besides the asian family and the ONE black guy, exactly 10 exceptions (at the time) of people who had moved into town, of which I was one of. So as such, I was an outsider, and I had never heard of or met this woman in my life. And here's what I learned about her:

She's never done any drugs in her life, legal or illegal, with one exception being painkillers for a broken ankle years ago (of which she never took for any reason ever again.) She wasn't a smoker, she wasn't even a drinker. In a town of proud Irish. She lived next to the pub, for Christs sake, and not even a drop of temptation from her. She was of a particular breed of evangelicalism, fear-driven, sheltered life that shaped her perspective on the world. Hell, she didn't even like going to the library (though I don't blame her in this case, our library sucked,) but she didn't like going there because it was a library so small I've seen larger apartments and smaller closets packed more than that library. No, she didn't like going there on principle. She actively hated things remotely alien to her, and that included this scary new thing, you might have heard of it, heck you might have even gotten here because of it if you're lucky (RIP all of our CD shareware users.) It was called the internet, and thus by extension, she was scared of me. Scared out of her god-damned mind that this STRANGER pulled up into HER Subway with the fucking Matrix in his backpack. But the only thing she hated more, the ONE thing, was learning.

But, there was one thing she would use to expand her horizons, learn new things, and see things outside her only home beyond whatever her husband told her.

FACEBOOK.

(Yes, I realize the irony, but considering her lacking education, you can't exactly expect her to know the difference.)

She would go on there as much as she possible could to chat (or cheat) with friends, and see what was going on in the big wide world. Or, at least, she tried, before she got sucked into the antifa and amway black hole in which she would never return, having been radicalized from the start and now being negatively supercharged into a fucking extremist stereotype.

Because you see, she saw everything on the internet as being quite literal, with no room for interpretation or error; Whatever she read *must* be true. This is the sort of person most susceptible to propaganda of any kind, for any reason, and in any form. Don't believe me? This woman, as I would later learn, about 3 years prior to my arriving in that town, had seen an ISIS propaganda video, the one where it's a training video. I won't link it, I expect you to either know about it already, or remain in blissful ignorance. Trust me, it's better she saw that one than one of their beheadings. So she saw this video and joined their cause (in name) right after. That includes all of their beliefs too, the complete package. I never found out how that ended, but she was simultaneously as malleable as cotton candy, but the most racist, stubborn old woman I ever had the displeasure of knowing.

So knowing this, what caused her to believe that I was some hacker out to ruin her life?

The Matrix, and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU

Yes, THAT video. UNIRONICALLY that video.

I know it was that video because, after about 40 minutes, the employee, who I now knew was her nephew (or cousin or something, I don't remember exactly what their relationship was other than that they were extended family) got her to show said nephew what video she saw as a warning against hackers and cyber pirates on her brand new iPhone. And holy shit you guys, I wish I captured his face on film, because I have never seen, heard, or imagined, much less FELT a face palm strike a man's head so loudly.

The Subway guy finally turns to me, and convinces this woman to show her what she saw on my computer again so that this whole thing could be defused. Also, bearing in mind, the 911 responder is *still* on the phone here, and on speakerphone now.

So I reboot my laptop, and windows starts doing it's thing with verbose mode on, which for those unaware is basically a real time report of every module windows loads to get the operating system going. It looks a bit like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwvu4LcqpMI

And as this is happening, I finally get the words out "This is windows booting without the windows logo," and just as everyone though the situation was defused, the woman flips her shit again, doesn't believe me, and accuses me of being a black man wearing "white face" all in one sentence, and she gets physical again.

At this point, I'm told by the Subway guy to get the hell out of there, damn it if the cops come. The cops never came, something that I learned after the fact was unusual, to say the least. I didn't go back there for a month in hopes of not running into that woman (which I never did, thank fuck.) When I did go back, the same guy was working there that shift, and I asked him what happened to The Karen, which is where I learned that after I left, so did she a couple minutes later to go chase me down like she was some sort of vigilante trying to hunt down Neo. But for some reason, she took the highway north along the 101 to Newport and beyond, and wasn't seen or heard from for a couple weeks.

When she came back, she was forced to go to a doctor to see if she had Alzheimer's or something to that affect, and then to a psychologist. Nope, there was nothing medically wrong with her, she was just a racist old self-proclaimed witch that had a history of harassing people that stretched 20 years. Never change, Waldport.

So that's the story of how a mAtRiX hAcKeR fUcKinG bECaMe bLAcK aNd tUrNEd To CRimE-->
