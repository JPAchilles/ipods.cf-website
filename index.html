                <p>So you may be wondering, what is this? Why are we here? This is a website, you've never seen one before.</p>
                <p>This site is a mix of 50% iPod modding wiki, 50% Minecraft Server related stuff, 50% Store, and 1000% absolute meme.
                    There are several pages and subdomains for a bunch of stuff, which you can brose from the navbar up top. I'm not really sure what else to
                    put here on the homepage, so here's the news.</p>
                <p>News:</p>
                <ul>

                <li>[April 24th, 2020] Minecraft pages added, evicted Herobrine from that directory.</li>
                <li>[April 20th, 2020] Added the secret page, removed Herobrine.</li>
                <li>[April 18th, 2020] The website is now up, two months after I had the idea, and one month after I had the motivation to make it. More info to come.</li>

<!-- Oh what? An ACTUAL website? Who could have imagined it would happen? Speaking of imagining, imagine not going to store.ipods.cf for those amazing deals;
You can go there for some Dankmus merch... actually, we don't have any of that, do we? Riiiiight, all we've got there is that HTML4 marquee
of a gif of a guy named GEIR, an original copypasta (an impossibly rare feat, I know) and a Squarespace advert. Fuck it, I've gotten your attention now. 
You wanna know something while you're here reading this? Do you have any idea how long it took me to figure out how the hell to make 
footers actually stick to the bottom of the page, out of sight? Five years. Five. Long. Years. That's how long it took us to get Harvest back.. 
nah wait, wrong game. But for real though, it took me OVER. ONE. FUCKING. YEAR. To get the damn footer to actually stay where it's supposed to. 
No joke, I'm going to use this site as a template for all my future projects simply because THE FUCKING FOOTER WORKS!!! I don't care how simple it is, 
I subscribe to the philosophy of the best solution usually being the simplest one, with good design being as little design as you can get away with
