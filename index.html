<!-- Oh what? An ACTUAL website? Who could have imagined it would happen? Speaking of imagining, imagine not going to store.ipods.cf for those amazing deals;
You can go there for some Dankmus merch... actually, we don't have any of that, do we? Right, all we've got there is that HTML4 marquee
of a gif of a guy named GEIR, an original copypasta (an impossibly rare feat, I know) and a Squarespace advert. Fuck it, I've gotten your attention now. 
You wanna know something while you're here reading this? Do you have any idea how long it took me to figure out how the hell to make 
footers actually stick to the bottom of the page, out of sight? Five years. Five. Long. Years. That's how long it took us to get Harvest back.. 
nah wait, wrong game. But for real though, it took me OVER. ONE. FUCKING. YEAR. To get the damn footer to actually stay where it's supposed to. 
No joke, I'm going to use this site as a template for all my future projects simply because THE FUCKING FOOTER WORKS!!! I don't care how simple it is, 
I subscribe to the philosophy of the best solution usually being the simplest one, with good design being as little design as you can get away with
