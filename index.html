<!-- Oh what? An ACTUAL website? Who could have imagined it would happen? Speaking of imagining, imagine not going to store.ipods.cf for those amazing deals;
You can go there for some Dankmus merch... actually, we don't have any of that, do we? Right, all we've got there is that HTML4 marquee
of a gif of a guy named GEIR, an original copypasta (an impossibly rare feat, I know) and a Squarespace advert. You wanna know something while you're here
reading this? Do you have any idea how long it took me to figure out how the hell to make footers actually stick to the bottom of the page, out of sight?
Five years. Five. Long. Years. That's how long it took us to get Harvest back.. nah wait, wrong game -->
